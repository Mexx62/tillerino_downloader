# tillerino_downloader

This script connects on the osu! IRC with your account then watches your PM and/or public channels for messages containing songs. Then it checks if you already have the song, if you don't, it will download it automatically. This enables you to PM Tillerino in-game, wait for the audio cue telling the download is finished, and F5-ing to add the new beatmap to your library.
